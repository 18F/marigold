# Government banner

## The “official government site” banner

<p>We recommend that all federal government sites include the “official government site” banner and a logo or site name. The banner helps people identify that your organization is part of the government, while the logo or site name helps visitors understand what your site is and what it does.</p>
<h4>Building with HTTPS</h4>
<p><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/11/13/why-we-use-https-in-every-gov-website-we-make/">HTTPS is a best practice</a> for all websites: It’s secure, private, and fast, and search engines prefer encrypted sites. But it’s especially important for government websites. The .gov in government websites carries a lot of weight. The public expects the contents of .gov websites to be official and accurate, and they expect any information they submit to that website to be private. The U.S. CIO provides guidance to implementing HTTPS for government websites at <a href="https://https.cio.gov/">https://https.cio.gov/</a></p>
