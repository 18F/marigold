title: Marigold
---

A set of reusable components and tools for building websites and applications at 18F. The goal of Marigold is to gather and store patterns and reference materials that help every project at 18F build useful, delightful experiences. Our hope is that this will help us record what we learn and save us all time.

**How is this related to the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards?**

The [Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/) aim to be a cohesive design system for government websites. Marigold is a messy, experimental spot to record how we've solved problems and store knowledge we want to be shared within 18F.
